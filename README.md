## LC-MS/MS derived phosphoproteomic data from patient-derived ER+ breast tumors obtained at 3 treatment timepoints:
  - Untreated, proliferating control
  - Short-term treated, drug adapted
  - Long-term treated, proliferating drug resistant 
  
#### Objective: Calculate differential peptide abundance and perform kinase prediction and PTM-pathway enrichment to identify kinase activity driving the resistant phenotype. Probe targets for therapeutic efficacy in evading drug resistance and preventing local recurrence in pre-clinical breast cancer models.
